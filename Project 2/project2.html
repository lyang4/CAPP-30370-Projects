<h2> About Me and My Goals </h2>

<p>I am a junior at the <b>University of Notre Dame</b> majoring in Finance and Computer Applications 
and minoring in Chinese. At school, I participate in a variety of extra-curricular activities 
including Parliamentary Debate Team, Student International Business Council, and Investment club. 
I also enjoy playing violin and tennis during my free time. After graduation, but before starting 
full-time, I'd like to travel to around in Europe and Asia for a couple weeks. As for career goals I hope to work
for the investment/asset management division of a large bank or directly for an investment management 
firm. However, I have also looked into hedge funds or working as a technology consultant at a consulting firm so <em>I'm
not really sure what I'd want to do yet.</em> Hopefully I'd get to start out living in a big city and then move out
into the suburbs after a couple years. During my time off, I'd love to travel to as many countries as possible. </p>
